# XamlIslandsMinimalSample
A minimal C++ Xaml Islands sample that supports console, Win32, and Xaml, and uses menus and accelerator keys as well as a Xaml-designed UserControl in a secondary dll project. 

The main C++ file is 133 lines and was started from another project I was working on called vMulti.
